# Soccer-Player-Performance-Data
Introduction: Through the use of the project, the main goal was to practice finding instances of correlation using real life data. This project analyzes European soccer player statistics with the intent to determine correlations between their ages, minutes played, and goals + assists. 

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mamounkabbaj/2023-2024-big-5-european-soccer-player-statistics

Methods Used:
- Descriptive analysis using python libraries such as statistics and numpy.
- Data Visualization using the python library matplotlib.

Insights and conclusions: I found that there was a relationship between minutes forwards played, and gosals + asissts for forwards in the top 5 European leagues. I also found that the ages of players had no correlation with their goals + assists.
